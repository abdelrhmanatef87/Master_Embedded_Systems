| **EX1: Example of Multidimensional Array In C** |
|----------------------------------------------|
| Write a C program to find the sum of two matrices of order 2x2 using multidimensional arrays, where the elements of the matrix are entered by the user. |
| **Output** |
| Enter the elements of the 1st matrix |
| Enter a11: 2 |
| Enter a12: 0.5 |
| Enter a21: -1.1 |
| Enter a22: 2 |
| Enter the elements of the 2nd matrix |
| Enter b11: 0 |
| Enter b12: 0.5 |
| Enter b21: -1.1 |
| Enter b22: 23 |
| Sum Of Matrix: |
| 2.2 9.5 |
| -0.9 25.0 |

| **EX2: C Program to Calculate Average Using Arrays** |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| This program takes 'n' numbers of elements from the user (where 'n' is specified by the user), stores data in an array, and calculates the average of those numbers. |
| **Output** |
| Enter the number of data: 6 |
| Enter number: 45.3 |
| Enter number: 67.5 |
| Enter number: -45.6 |
| Enter number: 20.34 |
| Enter number: 33 |
| Enter number: 45.6 |
| Average = 27.69 |

| **EX3: C Program to Find Transpose of a Matrix** |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| This program asks the user to enter a matrix (size of the matrix is specified by the user), and this program finds the transpose of that matrix and displays it. |
| **Output** |
| Enter rows and columns of the matrix: 2 3 |
| Enter elements of the matrix: |
| Enter element a11: 1 |
| Enter element a12: 2 |
| Enter element a13: 9 |
| Enter element a21: 0 |
| Enter element a22: 4 |
| Enter element a23: 7 |
| Entered Matrix: |
| 1 2 9 |
| 0 4 7 |
| Transpose of Matrix: |
| 1 0 |
| 2 4 |
| 9 7 |

| **EX4: C Program to Insert an element in an Array** |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Output** |
| Enter the number of elements: 5 |
| 12345 |
| Enter the element to be inserted: 6 |
| Enter the location: 2 |
| 162345 |

| **EX5: C Program to Search an element in an Array** |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Output** |
| Enter the number of elements: 5 |
| 11 22 33 44 55 |
| Enter the element to be searched: 44 |
| Number found at the location = 4 |
